\section{Test Programs}
In addition to the supplied test bench and program, we made another test bench which can be found in \emph{tb_toplevelfib.vhd} for a program we wrote ourselves.
This allowed us to test more of the functionality as well as checking whether we were able to produce a program which behaved correctly for our CPU.

\subsection{Supplied test program}
We were supplied with the following test program, translated from machine code to assembly:
\begin{verbatim}
00: lw r1, 1(r0)    -- Data = 2
01: lw r1, 2(r0)    -- Data = 10
02: lw r1, 2(r0)    -- Data = 10
03: add r3, r1, r2
04: sw r3, 5(r0)
05: beq r0, r0, 2    -- Destination = 7
06: sw r3, 3(r0)
07: sw r3, 4(r0)
08: sw r3, 6(r0)
09: sw r3, 7(r0)
10: lui r3, 6
11: sw r3, 8(r0)
12: add r3, r1, r3
13: sw r3, 9(r0)
14: beq r0, r0, -3    -- Destination = 11
15: sw r3, 10(r0)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Self made test program}
This test program is a simple program that should calculate the first fibonacci number larger than a given number.
In order to function properly, the data memory has to contain the value 1 at the address 0x1, 2 at 0x2 and the limit at 0xf.
When the number is found, it can be read at the address 0x10.

Below is the source code for the test program:
\begin{verbatim}
00: LW r1,0x1(r0)
01: LW r2,0x2(r0)
02: LW r3,0xf(r0)

LOOP:
ADD r4,r1,r2
ADD r1,r2,r0   ; Move
ADD r2,r4,r0   ; Move
SLT r4,r3,r2   ; $4 = $3 < $2
BEQ r0,r4,LOOP ; If !($3 < $2), go to LOOP

SW r3,0x10(r0) ; Store value at 0x10

INFILOOP:
J INFILOOP     ; Keep on spinning, a simple jump test
\end{verbatim}

\section{Simulation}
\subsection{Supplied test program}
The execution of the first three instructions can be seen in figure \ref{fig:sim1}. As expected, these load word instructions makes use an extra stall cycle. The figure shows that data is loaded correctly from memory into the \emph{reg_write_data} signal, and that the register file is updated at the following clock cycle. Note that the register contents is too big to display in the figure, but the data is stored correctly. Since instruction 2 is indentical to instruction 1, nothing happens except for state traversal and incementation of the program counter.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/sim1.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:sim1}Simulation Part 1 - Instruction 0,1,2}
\end{figure}

Next, the action starts in figure \ref{fig:sim2}. First up is the add instruction, where the data from the load instructions are added together. The result can be seen in the signal \emph{alu_r}, and is written to registry 3 as specified by the signal \emph{rd}. Then the result is stored to the memory at address 5, which can be seen is successful as the signal \emph{dmem_data_in}, which is the data coming in to the processor from the data memory, reflects the change. Next the branch instruction can be seen asserting that zero is indeed equal to zero, and branches two instructions ahead to instruction 7, which stores register 3 to address 4.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/sim2.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:sim2}Simulation Part 2 - Instuction 3,4,5,7}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:sim3}, it can be seen that register 3 is also stored to address 6 and 7, before the load upper immediate function replaces the contents of register 3 by $6 << 16$, as seen in the signal \emph{reg_write_data}. Finally the result is stored to memory address 8.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/sim3.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:sim3}Simulation Part 3 - Instruction 8,9,10,11}
\end{figure}

Things are finished off in figure \ref{fig:sim4} where register 3 is set to register 3 added by register 1 before the result is also stored to the memory at address 9. Afterwards, the branch instruction once again asserts that zero is indeed zero, and jumps to instruction 11, doomed to repeat the same loop for all eternity, slowly increasing the contents of register 3.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/sim4.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:sim4}Simulation Part 4 - Instruction 12,13,14,11}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Self made test program}
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{figures/fibtest.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:fibsim}Register values when program has found the appropriate fibonacci number. r1 is contained in the {\color{red} red box}, r2 in the {\color{green} green box}, r3 in the {\color{blue} blue box} and r4 in the {\color{magenta} purple box}.}
\end{figure}

As we can see from figure \ref{fig:fibsim}, r2 holds the number 21, which is the first fibonacci number after the number 16, which is stored in r3.
