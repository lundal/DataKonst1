CPUs are advanced technology, and understanding them is hard. A good way to
do that is to DIY and implement it. In this project, a MIPS
architecture is implemented in VHDL, and attempted tested on an FPGA. The
implementation was first simulated and shown to work. However, problems arose
when attempting to upload the synthesized project to the FPGA.
