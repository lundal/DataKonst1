\subsection{Loading the design on to the FPGA}
\label{subsec:uploadproblems}

After successfully generating the programming file, we went on to upload the processor to the FPGA.
AvProg managed to connect to the FPGA board, and upload seemed to going well, it went as far as saying so only to give an error message a second later: \textbf{No ACK from state 12}.
The problem persisted even after increasing AvProg's timeout (as suggested by ref, page 40). % TODO http://www.em.avnet.com/Support%20And%20Downloads/Avnet_AvProg-UserGuide_v4_0_5_1.pdf

It seemed like we were able to connect to the FPGA with host.py and send commands, but we never got any response so we have no idea whether we actually managed to connect.
As the deadline approached at a second every second and we did not manage to come any closer to uploading, we decided it was a better use of our time to improve on what we actually could improve.
